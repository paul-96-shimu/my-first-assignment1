                    Hasina has long been accused of implementing repressive authoritarian measures against her political
                    opponents, critics, and the media. During her regime, it was common for anyone who spoke against the
                    government to be abducted, subjected to extrajudicial killings, or imprisoned. Finding justice and
                    securing one's rights was rare and seemingly an unattainable dream during her rule.
